    <p>Was it easy to guess the gender identity of the singer in those breakup songs? If it was, that's not surprising: gender runs deep in how we how we express ourselves and pop music  is a place where roles are often highlighted and  reinforced.</p>

    <p>In the US music industry, <a href= "https://news.usc.edu/135288/in-music-industry-female-songwriters-and-producesr-are-outnumbered-by-men/" >the number of men </a> outnumbers the number of women, especially in roles of power such as songwriters and producers. According to a recent <a href ="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/news/women-artists-music-study-2021-1138094/"> report on diversity among music creators from the University of Southern California's Annenberg Institute</a>, about 21 percent of artists are women, as are 12 percent of songwriters and about 2 percent of producers. Unfortunately there is not enough data collected on non-binary artists in the music industry and the role they play within the sector. </p>

    <p>Not only there is a lack of women and other gender indenties in power within the music industry, there is an imbalance of who we here on the radio and on streaming platforms. According to a <a href ="https://program.ismir2020.net/poster_2-11.html"> Spotify</a> report released in 2020 only about 1 in 5 streams are female artists. While there is even a smaller number of non-binary artists that are being streamed on the platform as well.</p>
    
    <p>The imbalance in gender and power in music influences all aspects of the industry, down to the songs that are performed by and written for artists. Gender and love had played an important role in music. They allow us to express ourselves at key moments, such as when love goes bad. Yet many song lyrics have gendered themes that are often based on <a href ="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00411/full">gender stereotypes</a> and focused on  <a href ="https://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1481063/FULLTEXT01.pdf">gendered roles</a>.</p>
    
    <p>It is important to understand these lyrics and how they <a href ="https://www.stylist.co.uk/life/music-and-misogyny-why-were-all-listening-to-sexist-lyrics/56419"> influence</a> our views on gender and others, pop culture influence how the audience view different topics and pop music play an important role in that.</p>
    <h2>Analysis Music Themes and Lyrics</h2>

        <p>Gender representation in lyrics highlights a larger issue of gender representation in the music industry. Regardless of the gender of the artist, the majority of the producing and songwriting team are still men.</p>
        <p>According to the <a href = "https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-inclusion-recording-studio2021.pdf">same USC study</a>, out of 900 songs there is less than 1% that have only women song writers, while out of the 900 songs only about 31% have women song writers, and about 58% have of those songs have no women songwriters.</p>

        <p>With the lack of women and non-binary and gender non-conforming folks in positions of power in the music industry it impacts and influnces all aspects of the industry such as how songs are written and what themes are in the music. </p>

        <p>Many of the songs that were discussing love and breakups follow similar lyrical themes. Regardless of gender, most focus on the major themes of anger and emotions as well as negative feelings towards their exes.</p>

        <p>Both male and female singers tend to focus on three main aspects of the breakup: the singers themselves, the ex, and the relationship. Lyrics focusing on themselves include the singer's feelings or actions that they have done or felt because of the breakup. Lyrics about their exes focus on what the ex has done since the breakup or how they might be feeling. Lastly, lyrics about the effects of the relationship usually focus on things on how it made the singer feel or how it made a worse or better person.</p>

        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-table" data-src="visualisation/7701866"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>

        <p>However, even with similar structures in music, the lyrics themselves are usually <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815278/">heavily gendered</a>. Many pop songs' lyrics fall victim to tropes and gendered stereotypes, especially when talking about love and exes. </p>

        <h2>Pronoun Count Breakdown</h2>
        <div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7699438"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
        <figcaption>This is the pronoun count of about 100 breakup songs from the Billboard Top 100 charts. Songs picked included from various male artists, female artists and non-binary artists and those who also 'they/them' pronouns in addition to using 'he/him' or 'she/her' pronouns.</figcaption>
        <p>Based on the sample of 64 breakup songs from the Billboard Top 100, regardless of gender artists tend to use about the same amount of 'I' and 'you' pronouns in songs. However, songs by female identiting artists uses slightly more 'our' and 'us' pronouns. </p>

<p>The lyrics in the male artists' songs focus more on anger and often follow an action due to the relationship.</p>

    </div>
<p>The lyrics in the female artists' songs tend to be more focused on themselves and how they're feeling.</p>

    </div>

<p>Songs with neutral lyrics tend to be less explicit with the major themes and were in the middle of the spectrum of breakup songs. </p>


<h2>How males and females talk about breakups</h2>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-survey" data-src="visualisation/7722977"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<p>Male artists tend to focus on what they are going to do after the breakup: party, drink or do drugs, or even have sex. Males singers tend to be angry towards their ex, call them names and blame them for the breakup. </p>


<div class = "songwrapper">
    <div class="song">

        <p>"Hot Girl Bummer," Blackbear</p>
    </div>    
</div>

<p>Female artists tend to focus mostly on their emotions, and thinking about the relationship, and then focusing on themselves after the event. These stereotypical feminine terms follow the trends of langauge used for female or feminine terms <a href = "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815278/"> being more "emotional"</a>.</p>

        </div>

    </div>

<p>However, there are still overlapping themes of emotions caused by the breakup and what happened afterward. In additon, not all songs were as explicit with these themes and there were songs that were in the middle of the spectrum. The main shared themes were anger and regret in the aftermath of the breakup. The main difference was what language was used and how the artists talk about the breakup or their ex. </p>

<h2>Gender Breakdown in the Music Industry</h2>
<h4>Top Billboard 100 Artists</h4>
<div class="flourish-embed flourish-chart" data-src="visualisation/7706827"><script src="https://public.flourish.studio/resources/embed.js"></script></div>
<figcaption>The past month the top 10 artists were majority male-identifying singers, the past month there were usually less than 5 female-identifying artists charting the Billboard 100's.</figcaption>

<h2>Gender in Music </h2>
<p>Gender in music has been a topic that has been an issue throughout time, with more and more artists speaking out on the inequalities they faced in the industry. This issue creates an unhealthy culture for those in the industry and allows for sexism to thrive. There are more men in the music industry compared to women, leading to an imbalance of representation in the industry. </p>

<p>The lack of representation in the industry creates the issue of how <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-55387-001">songs</a> are written and what goes on behind the scenes. The imbalance of gender leads to songs having <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4815278/"> gendered themes</a> and stereotypes that influence the meaning of the song.</p>

<p>Regardless of the artist's gender identity, the majority of their <a href ="https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-inclusion-recording-studio-20200117.pdf">songwriters and producers</a> are men, often many of these teams are made of all men or a small handful of women. However, even with a majority of the songwriters and producers being males, there are differences in how songs are written depending on the artist that was singing the song. </p>

<p>However, there has been a shift in the industry, and more <a href="https://www.voxmagazine.com/arts/lgbtq-representation-rising-in-the-music-industry/article_faa90d42-10c7-11ec-aa33-b30ed402ff28.html">queer</a> artists are producing and music. The increase number of queer artists may allow for a shift in the music industry in the future to be more inclusive of all regardless of identity.</p>

<p>In addition to the increase of queer artists in music, there has been an increase of <a href ="https://assets.uscannenberg.org/docs/aii-inclusion-recording-studio-20200117.pdf">women Grammy nomiees</a> recently. In 2020 the catergory of "Song of the Year" had 44% women nominees, the highest number of nominees in recent history. </p>

<p>With the slow change in the music industry with gender representation, there might be a shift in culture within the industry and a possible change in how lyrics and songs are written.</p>
    
    <h2>Methodology </h2>
<p>To analyze gender pronouns and themes in the songs, lyric data was collected online and then entered into AntConc and Voyent Tools, allowing for lyrical analysis such as word combinations and collecting usage of pronouns. While R and Flourish were used to create the data visualizations of the pronouns, I used Julia Silge's R code <a href= "https://juliasilge.com/blog/gender-pronouns/"> Gender Roles with Text Mining and N-grams</a> to help create visualizations. In addition, to the R code <a href="https://flourish.studio/"> Flourish</a> was used to make some other graphics. </p>

<p>The corpus of the songs included 64 pop songs from the Billboard 100, 30 songs were from male artists, 30 from female artists and 4 from non-binary or artists that use they/them pronouns in addition to she/her or he/him pronouns. </p>
<p>To collect the amount of pronouns in each of the songs, I manually picked breakup songs from Billboard and collected the lyrics into a spreedsheet, once those lyrics were saved I imported the files into AntConc and it scraped through the list of break up song lyrics. In AntConc I set the scrapped lyrics and used the advanced search opition to search for the pronouns: "I","You", "me","he", "she", "we" and "us". Once the lyrics that included those words, I saved them and cleaned the data in a spreadsheet. Data clean up includes cleaning up contractions and correcting spellings of words.</p>

<p>After the words were collected and saved the data was imported into R and using the code from Julia Silgle's GitHub I was able to create some data visualizations using the pronouns and highlighting what words came after them. In addition, the data set was imported in Flourish and I created the visualizations of the pronouns, allowing for visualizations to be created on the amount of pronouns that appear.</p>

<p>To count for themes of the songs, I manually scrapped lyric data from the songs and put the major themes into 4 different categories, which were: anger, self improvement, sadness and partying/drinking. These were the most common themes that appeared in these songs and some of the songs have overlap with some thimes</p>

<p>Artists', songwriters', and producers' gender identities were collected from their Wikipedia page and online articles and news sources. Song data come from lyric sites such as <a href="https://genius.com/">Genius</a> and <a href="https://www.azlyrics.com/"> AZLyrics</a>, and songs that were chosen came from the <a href ="https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100">Billboard 100's charts</a>. The songs that were picked had lyrics and themes that had some sort of references to a past relationship or an ex. </p>
